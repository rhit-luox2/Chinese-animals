The only thing that is recommended is they need to have independence in their relationship and keep an open mind.  \nHorse & rabbit: Horses and rabbits are opposites. To work well together, they must be willing to compromise. Their compatibility is their unconscious need for each other. For example, the friendly, cautious rabbits are drawn to the resolute, hot-tempered horses. Their compatibility depends on the genders of the horse and rabbit.", "Famous people who is this zodiac: Paul McCartney, Angela Merkel, Jackie Chan, Kobe Bryant, Kristen Stewart, and Greta Thunberg", "picture/horselong.jpg", "picture/squareHorse.jpg");
